I think everyone using Protractor to test their AngularJS based web app should be able to easily:
- Automatically install all node dependencies
- Run all specs with a single command
- Run tests in parallel
- Run the same tests in different browsers
- Have XML JUnit format reports consolidated for easy integration with CI such as Jenkins
- Have a HTML format easily readable report with screen captures

Requirements:
1. Install Node.js
2. Install Grunt-cli
